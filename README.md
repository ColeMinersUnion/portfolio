# Notes!

I need to fix the set background hook in main.jsx layouts. I either neet to abandon the main layout for other examples or learn how context works. 

Learn how to treat the size between the navbar and the bottom of the screen as the viewport for anything except the initial layout

Seems relatively easy to build

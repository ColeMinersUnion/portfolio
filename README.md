# Inspiration

1. [Astroshock](https://astroshock.com/)
Fun and colorful
2. [Studio](https://www.netdreams.co.uk/)
Very complicated but I like how chaotic it is
3. [Hasque](https://hasque.com/)
Seems relatively easy to build
4. [Diana](https://diana.lu/)
Not necessarily perfect but I like the use of color and non-traditional design
5. [Elise](https://elisekim.co/)
One of my favorites, love the loading screen. Super colorful
